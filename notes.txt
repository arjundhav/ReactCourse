# README.md - is a markdown file that includes a lot of helpful tips and links that can help you while learning to use Create React App.

# node_modules - is a folder that includes all of the dependency-related code that Create React App has installed. You will never need to go into this folder.

# package.json - that manages our app dependencies and what is included in our node_modules folder for our project, plus the scripts we need to run our app.

# .gitignore -  is a file that is used to exclude files and folders from being tracked by Git. We don't want to include large folders such as the node_modules folder

# public -  is a folder that we can use to store our static assets, such as images, svgs, and fonts for our React app.

# src - is a folder that contains our source code. It is where all of our React-related code will live and is what we will primarily work in to build our app.
